# Power Method

To generate the CSV files containing the data used in the graph, simply run the main method inside
the PowerMethod class. This method outputs two CSV files (power.csv and inverse.csv) corresponding to
the power method and inverse power method.

To run (and test) the power method itself, run the static method PowerMethod.power_method().
This method takes in the following arguments, the A matrix, a vector matrix as the first guess,
an error tolerance, and a max number of iterations.
